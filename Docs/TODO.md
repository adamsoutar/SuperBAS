# TODO in SuperBAS

*It's like a consortium... of me... the only contributor*

~~`!=` should also be aliased with `<>`~~

`;` should prevent `\n` in `PRINT`

~~Capitalisation should not be enforced on keywords or variables~~, though capitalisation for variables should be a config option.

`:` should allow multi-line `IF`

First reference to var should initialise it.

Should be able to assign with `LIST` and `DIM` statements

Arrays of string and uninitialised string (`LET a$`) vars should be `""` NOT `null`, this will also break compat with JS transpiler.

`INT` should be an alias for `FLOOR`
