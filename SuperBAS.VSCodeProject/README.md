## What is SuperBAS.VSCodeProject?

This folder is set up with an example VS Code project which will build and run your
application when you hit 'Run' from within the editor.

It runs within VS Code's integrated terminal, and is designed to make iterating
on SuperBAS apps easier.

##Â How do I use it?

Download this folder from GitHub as a zip (or clone it with the git cli), then
make a copy and rename it to whatever you like, then start editing Main.sbas.

Main.sbas is the entrypoint, but you can #include more files from within it.
